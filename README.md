# psybayes
Adaptive Bayesian stimulus placement of psychometric function for MATLAB.

`psybayes.m` implements Kontsevich and Tyler (1999) Bayesian adaptive method for estimation of parameters of the psychometric function via maximization of information gain.

See `psytest.m` for documentation and a working usage example.

This is a fairly bare implementation of Bayesian adaptive stimulus placement. For a comprehensive array of adaptive procedures and some pretty neat demos you could look at the [Palamedes](http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/) toolbox by Nicolaas Prins and Frederick Kingdom.
